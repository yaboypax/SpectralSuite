SpectralSuite is a low-latency implimentation of a few of my personal favorite FFT-based spectral FX. With the dry wet at 1.0 and no effect depth, you're still in the FFT zone and your transients will start to smear. This is not a precise tool for audio restoration, but a creative effect for production and sound design.

This project was written in C++ using the JUCE framework and fftw3 for the DSP math.
